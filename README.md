# EMU Print Center Management System
This is a Chrome extension for the EMU Print Center built with Vue.js. It is essentially an ordering/checkout system that shows the customer the current order items on a computer, with an attendant screen. Attendants can add items to the current order, finalize it, add orders from email, and view previous order history.

It utilizes Firebase for realtime data and attendant authentication. 

## Building
